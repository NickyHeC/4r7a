# project_install.md — Onboarding runbook for the assisting AI coding agent

You are an AI coding agent helping a human set up **company-brain**: a company
wiki "brain" (Markdown source of truth, mirrored to Notion) operated by a fleet
of specialist agents across their platforms. Follow this runbook step by step.

> **Read `memory.md` first.** It is a reverse-chronological development log that
> gives you the current architecture and recent decisions without reading the
> whole codebase — start there for context, then open specific files as needed.
> After making meaningful changes, prepend a new entry to it.

## Operating principles (read first)

- **The installer is the company admin.** They have access to all company
  accounts/providers and own access scoping. The full Markdown wiki is
  admin-only; **members read through Notion teamspaces** (the admin sets each
  teamspace's access level in Notion). The admin maps each wiki section to a
  teamspace in `config/notion.yaml` (`teamspaces` + `section_teamspace`), using
  `admin_only` to keep sensitive sections MD-only (never mirrored). The admin
  also sets each member's **ingest scope** (which of their accounts feed the
  wiki). Validated writes/ingests are generally allowed; reads are enforced by
  Notion. See the `access-control` rule.
- **Confirm before connecting each platform.** Tell the user what a step does and
  what token/scope it needs; wait for their go-ahead.
- **Finance is read-only.** Mercury and Ramp use read-only tokens. Never set up
  or attempt money movement, payments, card issuance, or limit changes.
- **Markdown first.** The wiki Markdown files are the source of truth; Notion is a
  mirror. Agents write Markdown via `write_wiki_page`, then sync.
- **Write only to the system of record.** Agents write to the wiki/Notion or a
  ledger doc as proposals a human reviews — never to a bank/card platform.
- **Never commit secrets.** Tokens go in `.env` (gitignored). Never print full
  tokens back to the user or place them in tracked files.
- **Verify with `company-brain doctor`** after each connection step.

## Step 0 — Choose deployment mode

Ask the user: local or cloud?

- **local** (default): wiki Markdown lives in `./wiki` (gitignored). Good for a
  single machine / trying it out.
- **cloud**: wiki Markdown lives on the cloud VM's persistent storage at
  `/workspace/wiki`. Set `COMPANY_BRAIN_MODE=cloud` and
  `COMPANY_BRAIN_WIKI_DIR=/workspace/wiki`. Default VM provider is
  **smol cloud** (Smol Machines); install the smolvm CLI and configure smol
  cloud credentials when using the default fleet.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill values as you go.

## Step 1 — Install and check

```bash
pip install -e .
company-brain doctor
```

For VM-backed runs (sandbox verification or cloud fleet), install the default
[smolvm](https://github.com/smol-machines/smolvm) CLI (Smol Machines):

```bash
curl -sSL https://smolmachines.com/install.sh | bash
smolvm --help
```

Local sandbox: set `COMPANY_BRAIN_SANDBOX=smolvm`. Cloud fleet (default provider):
set `COMPANY_BRAIN_MODE=cloud`, `COMPANY_BRAIN_RUNTIME=cloud`, and configure smol
cloud credentials when the `smol machine` integration ships. To use a different
cloud VM provider, set `COMPANY_BRAIN_VM_PROVIDER` to your provider key.

`doctor` prints the mode, wiki dir, runtime, and which platforms are connected.
Re-run it after each step below to confirm progress.

## Step 2 — Connect platforms

Do these in any order the user wants; only connect what they use. After each,
run `company-brain doctor` to confirm.

### Notion (required — early; the wiki visualizer)

Default teamspaces: **admin** (finance/legal/admin) and **company** (engineering,
product, growth). Optional department splits later via `config/notion.yaml`.

1. Install the Notion CLI (`ntn`) and run `ntn login`.
2. Set `teamspaces.admin` / `teamspaces.company` parent page IDs in `config/notion.yaml`
   (or run `company-brain init` for interactive discovery).
3. `company-brain notion onboarding run` — ingests existing Notion pages into MD.
   If the workspace already has content, structured mirror is **not** established until
   you re-run with `--confirm-mirror` (alongside 4r7a tree + Archive parents; old tree
   left for admin to delete after review).
4. Start steady-state: `company-brain notion manager` (or rely on onboarding handoff).

CLI: `notion sync-pull`, `notion manager [--once]`, `notion onboarding run [--confirm-mirror]`.

Verify: `doctor` shows Notion CLI authenticated; wiki pages bind via `notion_page_id`.
Handbook: [docs/agents/operations.md](docs/agents/operations.md) → Notion.

### GitHub (engineering department) — read-only
1. Install GitHub CLI (`gh`) and authenticate (`gh auth login`); read-only is enough.
2. The engineering agents (open PRs, feature updates, product features) will use it.

### Mercury (finance) — READ-ONLY token
1. Create a **read-only** Mercury API token; set `MERCURY_TOKEN` (and
   `MERCURY_ENV=production`). Install the Mercury CLI if available.
2. Never use a token with payment/transfer scope.

### Ramp (finance) — READ-ONLY via MCP
1. Create a **read-only** Ramp token; set `RAMP_TOKEN`.
2. Configure the Ramp MCP server (`RAMP_MCP_COMMAND`/`RAMP_MCP_ARGS`, or
   `RAMP_MCP_URL`). See https://docs.ramp.com/developer-api/v1/ramp-mcp.

### Slack (finance notifications)

Finance agents post to Slack via `config/operations.yaml` → `gmail.slack` channel
names (e.g. `#customer-support`). They reuse the wiki bot token below.

### Slack (operations platform) — **required wiki bot**; Weave optional

Two Slack apps:

| App | Env | Purpose |
|-----|-----|---------|
| **Wiki bot** | `SLACK_WIKI_BOT_TOKEN` (required) | Passive ingest, `@wiki`, customer support, open threads |
| | `SLACK_WIKI_APP_TOKEN` | Socket Mode (local default) for `company-brain slack events` |
| | `SLACK_WIKI_SIGNING_SECRET` | HTTP mode only |
| **Weave bot** (optional) | `SLACK_WEAVE_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_WEAVE_APP_TOKEN` | `@weave` system-change requests |

Legacy `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` is accepted as a fallback for the wiki bot only.

1. Create the **wiki** Slack app with Events + `app_mention`, `message`, `reaction_added`,
   `member_joined_channel`, `user_change` (for offboard signals). Install to workspace.
2. Set `SLACK_WIKI_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_WIKI_APP_TOKEN` (Socket Mode).
3. `company-brain slack sync-channels` — populate `config/slack_channels.json`.
4. `company-brain slack onboarding estimate` then `company-brain slack onboarding run`
   (default 30-day backfill; optional `--absorb`).
5. Start hot lane: `company-brain slack events` (persistent listener).
6. Start steady-state manager: `slack_manager` (or rely on onboarding handoff).

**Weave (optional):** second Slack app with `app_mention` only → set `SLACK_WEAVE_*`
tokens → `company-brain weave events`. Populate `config/notion.yaml`
`change_request_database` after Notion connect. W2 members in `members.yaml` only;
roster (`config/roster.yaml`) cannot invoke Weave.

**Admin CLI:** `slack channel list|tag|enable-connect`, `weave poll-approvals`,
`hr promote {roster_key}`, `hr offboard {member_key}`.

Verify with `doctor` (Slack wiki / Weave lines). Handbook:
`docs/agents/operations.md` (Slack), `docs/agents/admin.md` (Weave), `docs/agents/hr.md`.

### Discord (growth department) — read-only community bot

Open-source developer community ingest. The bot **reads only** — it never posts to
Discord. Draft replies for humans go to Slack `#discord`.

1. Create a Discord application + bot at https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Enable **Message Content Intent** (privileged) under Bot settings
3. Invite the bot to your community server with read/view permissions
4. Set `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` in `.env`
5. Set `discord.guild_id` in `config/growth.yaml` (right-click server → Copy Server ID)
6. Adjust `discord.exclude_channels` (default includes `off-topic`)
7. Sync channel registry: `company-brain discord sync-channels`
8. Estimate backfill: `company-brain discord onboarding estimate`
9. Run onboarding: `company-brain discord onboarding run` (default 30-day backfill; starts `discord_manager`)
10. Start Gateway: `company-brain discord gateway` (WebSocket hot lane — run alongside manager)

Add per-member `bindings.discord_id` (and optional `discord_handle`) in
`config/members.yaml` so the system can detect when a team member is already in a thread.

**CLI:** `discord gateway`, `discord manager`, `discord sync-channels`, `discord channel list`,
`discord onboarding estimate|run` (`--days`, `--all`, `--no-manager`, `--absorb`).

Handbook: [`docs/agents/growth.md`](docs/agents/growth.md).

### Gmail (operations department) — read + labels + DRAFT only, never send
Gmail is reached over MCP. Pick one path (`GMAIL_MCP_PROVIDER`, default `official`):

- **Official Gmail MCP (default, recommended for open source).** The admin uses
  their own Google Cloud project so the trust stays with them. In Google Cloud:
  enable `gmail.googleapis.com` and `gmailmcp.googleapis.com`, configure the OAuth
  consent screen with scopes `gmail.readonly` + `gmail.compose` + `gmail.modify`,
  create an OAuth client, and complete the consent flow. Set `GMAIL_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`,
  `GMAIL_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `GMAIL_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` (server URL defaults
  to `https://gmailmcp.googleapis.com/mcp/v1`). Set `GMAIL_MAILBOX=me` (or the
  connected email). The `gmail.modify` scope is required for label/archive/read
  state via `gmail_rest.py` (triage and sweep); MCP handles search/drafts.
  need a super admin to mark the OAuth app Trusted for the restricted scopes.
  Docs: https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/guides/configure-mcp-server
- **Composio (optional, less setup).** Set `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` and either
  `COMPOSIO_GMAIL_MCP_URL` (a pre-created server/session URL) or let the composio
  SDK mint a Tool Router session for `COMPOSIO_USER_ID`. Adds a vendor dependency.
  Docs: https://composio.dev/toolkits/gmail

Posture: agents only read, label, and draft — **never send**. Keep
`gmail.allow_send: false` in `config/operations.yaml`. Verify with `doctor`
("Gmail connection ... read+draft"). On first connect, run `gmail_onboarding`
(ensures labels, 30-day backfill triage, starts profile-enabled persistent agents
+ `gmail_manager`).

**Service profiles** (`config/operations.yaml` → `gmail.profiles`):

| Profile | Use case |
|---------|----------|
| `executive_assistant` (default) | Full EA package for startup founders — all labels, nested cold inbound/newsletters, every specialist |
| `employee` | Employee Gmail — attention 1–4, flat `Cold Inbound` / `Newsletters`, no Investor or Warm intro; investor/partnership/receipt agents off |
| `service_account` | Purpose-built inboxes — attention 1–3 only; minimal domain labels and agents; override per mailbox |

Set the active profile with `gmail.profile` (default) or `GMAIL_PROFILE=employee` per
deploy. Per-mailbox overrides: `gmail.mailbox_profiles` (see commented examples in config).
`gmail_manager` runs for every connected account; triage labels and dispatched
specialists follow the profile.

### Linear (engineering department)
Linear powers issue tracking for engineering agents (forthcoming) and cross-department
Gmail workflows (`inbox_task`, `team_on_it`). Pick one auth path:

- **Personal API key (recommended).** In Linear → Settings → Account → Security & Access,
  create an API key. Set `LINEAR_API_KEY`. Configure `linear.team_key` (e.g. `ENG`) or
  `linear.team_id` in `config/engineering.yaml`.
  Docs: https://linear.app/developers/graphql
- **Official MCP (optional).** Remote MCP at `https://mcp.linear.app/mcp` with the same
  API key as `Authorization: Bearer …` for Claude Agent SDK agents.
  Docs: https://linear.app/docs/mcp.md
- **Community CLI (optional).** Install [joa23/linear-cli](https://github.com/joa23/linear-cli)
  or similar, run `linear auth login`, and set `LINEAR_USE_CLI=1` to delegate reads/writes
  to the `linear` binary instead of direct GraphQL.

Connection layer: `engineering/linear/linear_client.py`. Verify with `doctor` ("Linear …").
See https://linear.app/llms.txt for the full doc index.

**Onboarding (once):** after `LINEAR_API_KEY` and `config/engineering.yaml` are set, run
`linear_onboarding` — it backfills Gmail task bindings, writes a **Structure Proposal**
proposal to the wiki (Notion mirror), runs slot_check, and starts the persistent
`linear_manager`. It does not wait for structure approval.

### Granola (operations department) — read-only meeting notes
Granola supplies AI meeting notes and transcripts. The persistent
**`meeting_watch`** agent polls the calendar and dispatches **`ingest`**
after each meeting ends, with a weekly **`miss_check`** as the backstop.

Pick a deployment mode (`granola.mode` in `config/operations.yaml`, or auto-detected from env):

- **Business plan — per-member keys.** Each teammate who uses Granola creates an API key
  in Granola → Settings → Connectors → API keys with **Personal notes** scope. List
  members in `granola.members` (label + email) and set keys via
  `GRANOLA_MEMBER_KEYS=alice:grn_...,bob:grn_...` or `GRANOLA_API_KEY_<LABEL>`.
- **Enterprise plan — company-wide key.** Create one API key with **Public notes** scope
  (notes must live in Team-space folders visible to the workspace). Set `GRANOLA_API_KEY`.

Docs: https://docs.granola.ai/introduction · Connection layer:
`operations/granola/granola_client.py`. On first connect, run **`granola_onboarding`**
(default **30-day** backfill via `granola.onboarding.backfill_days`, then starts the
persistent `meeting_watch`). Verify with `doctor` ("Granola meeting notes …").

### Google Calendar (operations department) — read + book meetings
Google Calendar uses the same OAuth setup pattern as Gmail. Enable
`calendar-json.googleapis.com` and `calendarmcp.googleapis.com` in your Google Cloud
project, add calendar scopes to the OAuth consent screen, and include them in the
token used by `GMAIL_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` (or set `GCAL_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN`).

Agents:
- **`calendar_availability`** — open slots for meeting proposals
- **`book_meeting`** — create events with guests and Google Meet links
- **`ext_meeting_scheduler`** (Gmail folder) — drafts time proposals or books confirmed meetings
- **`daily_agenda`** — optional morning Slack DM (`gcal.daily_agenda.enabled: false` by default)

Docs: https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/guides/configure-mcp-server
· Connection: `operations/gcal/gcal_client.py` + `gcal_rest.py`. Verify with
`doctor` ("Google Calendar …").

### LLM provider and model tiers

During wiki onboarding, configure how agents use LLMs:

```bash
company-brain models configure
```

Ask the user to choose:

1. **performance** — reasoning tier (most powerful model) for every LLM agent.
2. **balanced** (recommended) — per-agent tier tradeoff (absorb/reports on
   reasoning; draft replies and routine audits on standard).

This writes `config/models.yaml` (`mode`, `tiers`, `agents`, `agent_providers`).

**Mixed providers (strategy B):** MCP-native agents (absorb, draft_reply,
card_spend, subscription_audit) run on Anthropic; `budget_report` runs on
OpenAI when both keys are set. Set both `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and
`OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`.

**Token budget (optional):** enable in `config/models.yaml` under
`token_budget` — monthly USD cap ($250 default pool), runtime/builder guidance
split, alert at 80%, optional hard stop. Usage is tracked automatically from
LLM API responses; per-run caps (`run_limits`) enforce USD/steps/tool-call
limits outside the model.

```bash
company-brain models budget              # status + per-agent run caps
company-brain models budget --reconcile  # compare tracked usage vs Mercury vendor bills
company-brain models spot-check          # vibe eval samples → #wiki
company-brain admin manager              # monthly LLM expense + maintain (one pass)
```

**Monthly LLM ops:** `admin_manager` writes `admin/llm-expense/{YYYY-MM}.md` and
`admin/maintain/{YYYY-MM}.md`, refreshes `admin/agent-runtime.md`, and requests an
admin coding session on `#wiki-admin` when budget/duration/verify drift. Schedule in
`config/operations.yaml` → `admin.llm_ops`. Handbook: `docs/agents/admin.md`.

**Model health:** `company-brain doctor llm` pings configured models, auto-falls
back within `fallback_chains`, persists overrides in `models.yaml`, alerts
`#wiki-admin` on substitution, and (when budget enabled) reconciles tracked
spend against Anthropic/OpenAI card charges.

Hosted provider keys for local installs; GLM-5 self-host option unchanged below.

One knob — `COMPANY_BRAIN_LLM_PROVIDER` (legacy default provider) —
still selects the fallback when an agent has no explicit `agent_providers` entry.
Confirm API keys with the user.

- **local installs → a hosted provider key (default).** Locally installing GLM-5
  is not realistic, so default to `anthropic` (set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) or
  `openai` (set `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
  - *Option:* a local install can still use open-source GLM-5 by **remote-connecting
    to an open-source host** — set `COMPANY_BRAIN_LLM_PROVIDER=glm` and point
    `GLM_BASE_URL` at that host's OpenAI-compatible endpoint (and `GLM_API_KEY`
    if it requires one).
- **cloud installs → GLM-5 self-hosted (open-source, no external tokens) or a
  hosted key.** To run GLM-5 on the GPU VM, use **Ollama** (easier than pulling
  raw weights from the GitHub/HF repo — it handles download, quantization, and
  serving, and exposes an OpenAI-compatible API out of the box):
  1. Install Ollama (https://ollama.com/download) and start it (`ollama serve`).
  2. **Pull the newest GLM-5** from the Ollama model library:
     `ollama pull glm-5` (use the latest GLM-5 tag the library publishes).
  3. Set `COMPANY_BRAIN_LLM_PROVIDER=glm` and point `GLM_BASE_URL` at Ollama's
     OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`http://localhost:11434/v1`); `GLM_API_KEY` can
     be any non-empty value (`ollama` ignores it). Set `COMPANY_BRAIN_LLM_MODEL`
     to the exact Ollama model tag you pulled (e.g. `glm-5`). Add the host to
     `Smolfile` `[network] allow_hosts` only if Ollama runs off-VM.
  - GLM-5 is large (744B-A40B); run Ollama on a capable GPU VM. For high-throughput
    production serving, SGLang (RadixAttention) or vLLM (`--enable-prefix-caching`)
    remain alternatives — same `glm` provider, just a different `GLM_BASE_URL`.

The OpenAI Agents SDK specialists run on whichever provider is selected; the
Claude Agent SDK agents (absorb writer, MCP-native reasoning agents) use Anthropic
by default and can be pointed at an open-source model via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`
(a LiteLLM gateway). Verify with `company-brain doctor` (the `LLM:` line shows the
active provider, model, and endpoint).

## Step 3 — Onboard each connected platform

Run the one-time onboarding agents to backfill history for platforms the user
connected (these seed the wiki + Notion):
- GitHub: the `github_onboarding` agent.
- Finance: the `finance_onboarding` agent (backfills monthly + quarterly reports).
- Granola: **`granola_onboarding`** (default 30-day backfill, starts `meeting_watch`).
- Slack: **`slack_onboarding`** (`company-brain slack onboarding run` — estimate,
  backfill, starts `slack_manager`; run `company-brain slack events` for the hot lane).
- Employee wiki (optional): for each person in `config/members.yaml`, run the
  `employee_wiki_onboarding` agent — it creates the company `people/` stub and the
  member's `employee_wiki/{member}/_index.md`, then discovers/creates their Notion
  personal teamspace and syncs the index. Start `employee_wiki_manager` to
  materialize work events (Linear/Granola/Gmail/Slack) into per-member work logs.
  Members import existing notes as a zip of `.md` files via `employee_wiki_import`
  (quarantined, scanned, and admin-reviewed before promotion).
- External wiki (admin): mount a one-shot external Markdown wiki (zip of `.md`) via
  `external_wiki_import` into `wiki/external/{source}/`. Register the source in
  `config/external_sources.yaml`, review at `admin/mount-review/{id}.md`,
  approve with `ExternalWikiImportAgent.approve(...)`. Rebuild the fleet catalog with
  `company-brain catalog` (`admin/content-catalog.md` → admin Notion teamspace).

## Step 4 — Operate and verify

- Run or schedule the managers (e.g. `github_manager`, `monthly_expense`,
  `quarterly_calculation`, `employee_wiki_manager`). Locally they run in-process;
  in cloud they target VMs.
- Confirm the wiki Markdown appears under the wiki dir and mirrors to Notion;
  per-member pages appear under the employee wiki dir.
- `company-brain status` shows article counts and sync state.

## Adding a new platform later

When the user wants a new platform, follow the project rules in `.cursor/rules/`:
- `agent-organization.mdc` — department → platform → agents layout.
- `agent-construction.mdc` — which SDK/integration to use; finance is read-only.
- `wiki-data-flow.mdc` — Markdown-first, then sync to Notion.
- `agent-eval.mdc`, `agent-runtime.mdc`, `agent-scheduling.mdc`,
  `agent-onboarding.mdc`, `agent-lifecycle.mdc` — eval/cost gates, runtime,
  scheduling, onboarding, and lifecycle conventions.

Keep both docs in sync: `README.md` is for humans; this `project_install.md` is
the onboarding runbook for the assisting agent.
